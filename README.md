Fountain Codes
==============

Origin
------

This project arose out of a challenge presented on http://programmingpraxis.com
in which it was required to create a program that sent and received and
decoded data in
[fountain codes](http://programmingpraxis.com/2012/09/04/fountain-codes/) 

I'm now planning on, as a challenge to myself planning on creating a client
server pair. My linux box is between power supplies, so I'm going to start
it in Win32 (to work with mingw32), then linux; but maybe someone else will
work on that in the mean time.

- [x] Split the fountain management into it's own source file
- [ ] Change the functions to accept a block size (rather than having it
  `#define`d.
- [ ] Split the decode function into some more manageable little functions
